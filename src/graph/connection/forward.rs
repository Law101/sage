//! `**Forward Connection** connects two nodes together at a time.
//! This connection might occur multiple times.
//!
//! For example: `John --born in-> London` & `John --current location-> Fiji`.
//! Here, "John" is connected to both "London" and "Fiji", however "London" &
//! "Fiji" doesn't necessarily have a direct connection with "John".
